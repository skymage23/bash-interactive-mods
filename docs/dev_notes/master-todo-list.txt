1.Develop method of loading and unloading imods.
2.Develop and implement inheritance model.
3.Implement simple garbage collection that layers over Bash's
    garbage collection.
4.Develop a so-called "context stack" that allows for switching to
  a new shell context temporarily with imod support pre-loaded as well
  as certain, pre-selected holdovers from the previous context.
      Probably want to fork processes to do this with fresh copies of the Bash binary.
  Try to give the current context control over the Terminal Emulator.
      Re: To allow for full Bash interactive shell support even in sub-contexts.
